>  Submission for: **Data Titans Hackathon â€“ Solving Business & Economic Challenges with Analytics**

## Theme
Consumer Behavior & Business Strategy

*What drives customer spending habits, and how can businesses optimize pricing strategies?*

## Overview

In this project, we analyze customer behavioral patterns to:

- Identify customer segments through **clustering**
- Predict customer **conversion probability**
- Provide strategic insights to optimize **marketing**, **pricing**, and **personalization** tactics

Our solution was built and submitted for the **Data Titans Hackathon**, leveraging data science to tackle real-world economic and business strategy challenges.Businesses are increasingly facing challenges in understanding the **diversity of their customer base**. Without personalized strategies, they often overspend on ineffective marketing campaigns. This project addresses two core questions:

1. How can we segment customers based on spending habits and behaviors?
2. Can we predict customer conversion using historical data?

## Data & Features

The dataset includes:

- Demographic details (e.g., Age, Income, Location)
- Transactional behavior (e.g., Frequency, Amount Spent)
- Channel interaction metrics (e.g., Email Clicks, Online Visits)
- Labels indicating **conversion status**

## Methods & Tools

### Clustering

- **KMeans Clustering**: Unsupervised segmentation
- **Elbow Method & Silhouette Score**: Optimal cluster number

### Classification

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**
- **Grid Search CV**: Hyperparameter tuning
- **ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, F1**: Model evaluation
